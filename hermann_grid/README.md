<h1>Hermann Grid</h1>

The Hermann grid illusion is an optical illusion reported by Ludimar Hermann in 1870.[1] The illusion is characterized by "ghostlike" grey blobs perceived at the intersections of a white (or light-colored) grid on a black background. The grey blobs disappear when looking directly at an intersection.
